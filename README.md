# HERB – AI Symptom Companion

HERB (“HealthAI”) is a multimodal health triage assistant built with Next.js 16.  
Patients describe their symptoms, optionally add photos, and HERB analyzes the inputs with Google Gemini to return structured insights, recommended next steps, and a targeted list of nearby specialists.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Multimodal diagnosis** – Sends symptom descriptions and uploaded photos to Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`) for structured JSON insights.
- **Condition breakdown** – Shows probabilities, descriptions, and action items for each likely condition.
- **Specialty-aware maps** – Derives the appropriate medical specialty from the AI response and feeds it to the Google Places API to surface nearby hospitals/clinics. Users can jump straight to `/map` with context-preserving query parameters.
- **Responsive UX** – Friendly, glassmorphism-inspired interface with animated cards and accessible typography.
- **Client-side state sharing** – The latest AI response is stored in a tiny `useSyncExternalStore` wrapper (`lib/diagnosisResponse.js`) so the diagnosis page and map view can access the same data without relying on session storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.18+ (per Next.js 16 requirement)
- npm 9+ (or pnpm/yarn/bun if you prefer)
- Google Cloud project with **Gemini API** enabled
- Google Cloud API key with **Maps JavaScript** + **Places** enabled

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment variables
Create `.env.local` and add:

```bash
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_key_here
```

| Variable | Used In | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | `app/api/gemini/route.js` | Server-side Gemini requests |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | `components/MapComp.jsx` | Client Places & Maps SDK |

### 4. Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
# visit http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Production build
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 6. Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```

## 🗂️ Key Modules

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app/page.jsx` | Landing page with product messaging and CTAs |
| `components/DiagnosisForm.jsx` | Client form, Gemini call, result rendering, map CTA |
| `app/api/gemini/route.js` | API route that calls Gemini and normalizes JSON |
| `components/MapComp.jsx` | Google Map + Places search, optionally driven by AI response |
| `app/(routes)/map/page.jsx` | Map page that reads query overrides and shared diagnosis state |
| `lib/diagnosisResponse.js` | `useSyncExternalStore` wrapper exposing latest AI response |
| `lib/specialityHospitals.js` | Maps condition keywords/specialty hint to Places keyword/type |

---

## 🔄 Core Flow

1. **User submission** – `DiagnosisForm` captures symptoms and optional photos, converts images to base64, and posts to `/api/gemini`.
2. **Gemini analysis** – The API returns structured JSON (`analysis.summary`, conditions, follow-up notes, care level, and `whichSpecialityHospitalToGo`).
3. **Results UI** – The form displays conditions with probabilities, suggested actions, and a CTA to “Check specialty places”.
4. **State sharing** – The full response is saved via `setDiagnosisResponse()` so other views can read it.
5. **Map experience** – `/map` and `MapComp` derive the search settings from either query params or the shared AI response, calling Google Places to show nearby matches.

```

- **Presentation layer** – Client components render the landing, diagnosis, and map views; maps are lazy-loaded with the Google SDK to reduce bundle cost.
- **Serverless logic** – `app/api/gemini/route.js` sanitizes inputs, calls Gemini, normalizes the JSON contract, and returns a concise payload tailored for the UI.
- **State coordination** – `lib/diagnosisResponse.js` exposes a lightweight store so the map page can reuse the latest diagnosis without re-fetching the LLM.
- **External services** – Google Gemini powers the clinical reasoning; Google Maps/Places translate the inferred specialty into location results.

## 🔁 Workflow Architecture

1. **Input stage** – Users type symptoms, upload optional imagery, and submit via the form. Client validation ensures only supported formats reach the API.
2. **Inference stage** – `/api/gemini` composes a prompt from the user data, calls Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`), and enforces the expected JSON schema before responding.
3. **Insight stage** – The frontend parses the response into condition cards, triage level, and recommended next steps, persisting the object in the shared store.
4. **Navigation stage** – The map CTA passes query parameters (specialty, location hints); `MapComp` resolves those into Google Places queries to render nearby providers.
5. **Feedback stage** – Users can adjust inputs or rerun the analysis; fresh API responses overwrite the shared store to keep views synchronized.

## 📌 Notes & Limitations

- **Not medical advice** – HERB provides informational guidance only; the UI reinforces this disclaimer.
- **Privacy** – Images are processed in memory (converted to base64) and sent directly to Gemini; no persistent storage is used.
- **Error handling** – Network or parsing failures surface friendly error messages to the user.
- **Suspense requirement** – Components using `useSearchParams()` are wrapped in `<Suspense>` boundaries (e.g., the `/map` page shell).
